How to Record Earnings and Payments
==============================

For growers and funders, Greenstand's online [Earnings tool](https://admin.treetracker.org/earnings) records payments due and payments made.

In a typical case...

1 Growers plant trees and submit *capture* records by phone.

2 Greenstand consolidates multiple captures into a single record and calculates the earnings due for the lot.

3 Funders download *earnings* records, make payments to growers, then upload payment data for growers to see.

Contracts among growers, funders, and management organizations specify the details:

- Whether to use the Greenstand Earnings tool.

- How often and how many captures go into an earnings record.

- How and how much funders pay growers.

This document describes how to use and understand the various parts of Greenstand's online Earnings tool.

You may also find help in a more-detailed, less-procedural document: the Greenstand [Earnings Reference](earningsref.md).

## Get Earnings Data

Here is how to export a typical selection of growers' earnings data:

1 Direct your web browser to the [Earnings tool](https://admin.treetracker.org/earnings) and log in with the name and password you received from Greenstand.

2 Select a subset of records.
> Typically, you want only records that await your payment: Click on `Filter`. Select `Payment Status` > `Calculated`. 

> You can also select records by the name of the managing organization, or by grower.
> - Organization: Select a name from the menu.
> - Grower Phone Number, Name: Enter all or part of a number or name. If you enter both, the filter ignores the number and sorts by the name only.

3 Click `Apply`. The data table now shows only records that match your selection.

4 Select records by date, if you wish: Click on `Date Range`. Enter start and end dates. Click `Apply`
> Date selection works on the table's `Effective Date`. That is the date a given record was created.
> Records are created when the number or time-span of tree captures reaches the threshold specified in the contract between grower and funder.

5 Copy the data to your machine: Click `EXPORT`.
> The selected data is saved to a local file. That's <u>all</u> the selected data, not just the rows displayed on the current page.
> Exactly where data is saved, with what name, varies with your machine and your browser configuration.
> Most likely, the files automatically goes to a `Downloads` folder, or a prompt lets you specify a file name and location.

6 Process that data as you see fit.
> The file is in standart CSV format (comma-separated values). 
> That means plain text, one record per line, with values surrounded by "quotation marks" and separated by commas.
> The first line presents the field names, rather than values.
> You can import the file into your spreadsheet or accounting software, or read it with a text editor.

## Post a Payment

You can use the Earnings display to record a payment made, as follows:

*figure 2: Detail for one Earnings record*

1 Click on the record in question.
> You see a details dialogue for that record.

2 At the bottom of the dialogue, enter an ID and method.
> The `Payment Confirmation ID` can be most any string of characters that serves your purpose.
> The `Payment Method`, also a string of your choosing, describes how you paid the grower, "deposit" or "Visa" for example.

3 Click `LOG PAYMENT`.
> The dialogue closes. The `Status` of the record is now `Paid` and the `Payment Date` is today.

## Post Multiple Payments

You can record multiple payments by uploading a file of CSV data.

*figure 3: Administration menu*

Provide all the same fields that occur in exported earnings data, in the same order.  

Write one complete record per line. Surround values with "quotation marks." Separate values with commas.

<ins>Do</ins> include the field names in line 1.

Write the final value of each record, the `paid_at` date, in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

At its simplest, the process goes like this:

1 Export a file of Greenstand earnings data, as described [above](#get-earnings-data).

2 Edit the file to supply the three values missing from end each record: 
> - payment_confirmation_id`: Most any string of characters that serves your purpose.
> - `payment_method`: A string of characters that describes how you paid the grower, "deposit" or "Visa" for example.
> - `paid_at`: The date you made the payment, in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

3 Save the file.

4 Go to the Payments table in the Greenstand [administration panel:](https://admin.treetracker.org/payments)
> To get there, change the URL in the browser or navigate the Greenstand panel's menu.

5 Click `UPLOAD`. Then select your file.
> If all goes well, the message reads `Data Uploaded Successfully`, and the updated records display in the Payments table.

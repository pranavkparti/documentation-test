## Introduction

API requests need three headers:
- `TREETRACKER-API-KEY:<api-key>`
- `Authorization:Bearer <token>`
- `Content-Type:application/json`

Every user's first request to the API is [Authenticate](#authenticate).
     That returns a Bearer token good for about one year.
  
Do not confuse the `Bearer <token>` with the other use of *token* in the API.
    In all other cases, a *token* is a data object that describes a tree.

## Authenticate

Provide a wallet's name or ID, and its password. Receive a bearer token to go in the header of subsequent API requests. Without the bearer token, requests return `403: ERROR: Authentication, token not verified.`
```
POST /wallet/auth
```
#### Request body: 
```
{"wallet": "nameOrID", "password": "string"}
```
#### Response:
```
200: OK
{token: string}
```
#### Errors:
```
200: OK: 1.10.3
```
> *fix:* Use `POST`, not `GET`
```
404: Not Found
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><meta charset="utf-8"><title>Error</title></head><body><pre>Cannot POST /authnot</pre></body></html>
```
> *fix:* Post your request to `https://prod-k8s.treetracker.org/wallet/auth`
```
404: Not Found
404: Could not find entity by wallet name: <name>
```
> *fix:* Correct the value of `wallet` in the request body.
```
415: Unsupported Media Type
415: Invalid content type. API only supports application/json
```
> *fix:* Provide the header: `Content-Type:application/json`
```
401: Unauthorized
401: Invalid access - no API key
401: Invalid API access
```

```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422: "wallet" is required
422: "password" is required
```
> *fix:* Provide the request body: `{"wallet": "name", "password": "value"}`
```
401: Unauthorized
401: Invalid credentials
```
> *fix:* Correct the value of `password` in the request body.

#### Authorization errors in subsequent requests:
```
500: Internal Server Error
500: Unknown error (undefined)

## Transfers Explained

A *transfer* moves tokens from one wallet to another by a variety of paths. It is easy to confuse them. This section explains the process and terminology.

#### Post a transfer:

The `originating` user or wallet posts the initial transfer request.
That request asks to move tokens from the `source` wallet to the `destination` wallet. 
Understand that the originator can be either the source or destination. In other words,
tokens may move towards the originator, or away from the originator.

#### Accept or fulfill a transfer:

The `target` is the other party to the transfer. The target may be the source or destination of the tokens, depending on the request.

In some cases, the origin and target wallets are `managed` (belong to) the same user. In some cases, the origin and target have previously established a `trust` `relationship`. In those cases, the transfer will execute and complete immediately after the origin posts it.

But when the origin and target are relative strangers, the transfer does not complete until the target agrees to it. If the target is the destination, the target posts an `accept` request to the API. If the target is the source, the target posts a `fulfill` request to the API.

#### Decline or delete a transfer:

In the event that a target objects to a transfer, the target can post a `decline` request to the API.

The originator may withdraw a request before the target accepts, fulfills, or declines. To do that, the originator sends a `DELETE` request to the API.

#### Transfer states:

Every transfer data object includes a `state` property. Here's what it means:

`requested`: The origin of the request is the destination of the transfer. It awaits the target/source's request to fulfill the transfer.

`pending`: The origin of the request is the source of the transfer and awaits the target/destination's request to accept the transfer.

`cancelled`: The target of a transfer request has declined to accept or fulfill it. Or the originator of the transfer request has deleted it.

`failed`:

`completed`: The transfer has been accepted or fulfilled by the target. Or the transfer simply moved tokens between two wallets both managed by the originator of the request.

## Get Transfers by Wallet

For a specified wallet, get a list of the transfers in a specified state. The transfers available are those for which the origin, source, or destination is the currently authenticated wallet or any wallet it manages.
```
GET /wallet/transfers?limit=n&start=n&wallet=nameOrID&state=value
```
> limit: Required integer. The maximum number of transfer objects to return.

> start: Optional integer, defaults to 1, the beginning. Of the transfer objects in the wallet, the one to start the list. But the order of the transfers is unpredictable.

> wallet: Optional string or ID, defaults to currently logged-in wallet. List transfers to, from, or requested by this wallet.

> state: Optional string, defaults to * (all). Possible values: `requested, pending cancelled, failed, completed`.

#### Response, an array of transfer objects:
```
200: OK
{ transfers: [
  {
    id: transfer_id
    type: send, deduct, or managed
    parameters: {
      tokens: [token_id,token_id,token_id]

    claim: false
    originating_wallet: walletNameOrID
    source_wallet: walletNameOrID
    destination_wallet: walletNameOrID
  }
] }
```
#### Errors:
```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422: "state" must be one of [requested, pending, completed, cancelled, failed]
```
> *fix:* Fix the value of `state` in the request.
```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422: "limit" is required
422: "limit" must be a number
422: "start" must be a number

```
404: Not Found
404: Could not find entity by wallet name: <badName>

```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422: "wallet" is not allowed to be empty
```
> *fix:* The path need not include `wallet=`, but if it does, wallet must have a value: `wallet=<value>`

```
GET /wallet/transfers/<transfer_id>
```
> <transfer_id>: Replace with a transfer ID.

#### Response, a transfer object: 
```
200: OK

  destination_wallet: walletNameOrID
}
```
#### Errors:
```
404: Not Found
404: Can not find this transfer or it is related to this wallet
```

```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422: "transfer_id" must be a valid GUID
```

## Get Tokens by Transfer

Get a list of the tokens moved by a given transfer.
```
GET /wallet/transfers/<transfer_id>/tokens?limit=n&start=n
```
> <transfer_id>: Replace with a transfer ID.

> limit: Required integer. The maximum number of tokens to return.

  code: 500,
  message: Unknown error (result is not iterable)
}
```
[^ back to top ^](#treetracker-wallet-api-reference)

## Post Transfers

Send a request to move tokens from one wallet to another, as allowed by the wallets' trust relationships. Specify tokens by their IDs, or specify a number of tokens.

The session's authenticated wallet makes the request--it is the *originating_wallet*.

The other party to the request is the *requestee* or *target*.

Tokens are *debited* from from the *sender_wallet* and *credited* to the *receiver_wallet*.

If the wallets share the right [*trust relationship*](#trust-relationships-explained), transfers take place immediately and automatically. Otherwise, the server stores the request and waits for the requestee to accept or decline it.
```
POST /wallet/transfers
```
#### Request body: 
```
{
  "sender_wallet": "nameOrID",
  "receiver_wallet": "nameOrID",
  "bundle":{"bundle_size": integer}
}
```
#### or
```
{
  "sender_wallet": "nameOrID",
  "receiver_wallet": "nameOrID",
  "tokens": ["token_id","token_id"]
}
```
#### Response: 
  
```
201: Created
202: Accepted
```
`Created` means the transfer is complete.
`Accepted` means it awaits an accept or fulfill request from the target.

#### Response body, a transfer object:
```
200: OK
{
  id: transfer_id
  type: send, deduct, or managed
  parameters: {
    tokens: [token_id,token_id,token_id]
    |or|
    bundle: { bundle_size: integer }
  }
  state: completed, requested, or pending
  created_at: date
  closed_at: date
  active:true
  claim:false
  originating_wallet: walletNameOrID
  source_wallet: walletNameOrID
  destination_wallet: walletNameOrID
}
```
#### Errors
```
404: Not Found
404: Could not find entity by wallet name:<wallet_name>
404: can not found token by id:<token_id>
```
> *fix:* Fix the wallet names and/or token IDs in the request body.
```
403: Forbidden
403: Do not have enough tokens to send
```
> *fix:* Decrease the value of `bundle_size` in the request body.
```
403: Forbidden
403: The token <token_id> can not be transfer for some reason, 
     for example, it's been pending for another transfer
```
> *fix:* Change the list of token IDs in the request body. 
Or replace the list with `bundle: { bundle_size: n }`.
If you own the token, you can learn what has happened by posting a
request to [get transactions by token ID](#get-transactions-by-token-id). 
When a transfer request asks you to send tokens, 
respond by posting a request to [fulfill the transfer](#fulfill-transfer), 
not by posting a new transfer.
```
403: Forbidden
403: The token <token_id> do not belongs to sender wallet
```
> *fix:* Fix the list of token IDs in the request body. 
Or write `bundle: { bundle_size: n }`. 
You can get a list of the tokens you own with a request to 
[get tokens by wallet](#get-tokens-by-wallet).
```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422:"tokens[n]" contains a duplicate value
```
> *fix:* Do not list the same token twice in the request body.
```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422: "bundle.bundle_size" must be a number
422: "bundle.bundle_size" must be greater than or equal to 1
```
> *fix:* For the value of `bundle_size`, provide a positive integer,
with or without quotes.

[^ back to top ^](#treetracker-wallet-api-reference)

## Accept Transfer

A destination wallet completes a pending transfer by accepting in-coming tokens.
```
POST /wallet/transfers/<transfer_id>/accept
```
> <transfer_id>: Replace with a transfer ID.

#### Response, a transfer object:
```
200: OK
{
  id: transfer_id
  type: send, deduct, or managed
  parameters: {
    tokens: [token_id,token_id,token_id]
    |or|
    bundle: { bundle_size: integer }
  }
  state: completed
  created_at: date
  closed_at: date
  active:true
  claim:false
  originating_wallet: walletNameOrID
  source_wallet: walletNameOrID
  destination_wallet: walletNameOrID
}
```
#### Errors:
```
403: Forbidden
403: Current account has no permission to accept this transfer
```
> *cause:* Only the target destination can accept a transfer. The originating wallet is not allowed to.
```
403: Forbidden
403: The transfer state is not pending
```
> *cause:* The transfer state is `requested`.
The transfer asks the target wallet to *send* tokens, not receive them.
The target source can either fulfill or decline. It cannot accept.

[^ back to top ^](#treetracker-wallet-api-reference)

## Fulfill Transfer

A source wallet completes a requested transfer by sending out-going tokens to their destination.
```
POST /wallet/transfers/<transfer_id>/fulfill
```
> <transfer_id>: Replace with a transfer ID.

#### Request body:
```
{"implicit":true}
```
> `implicit` sends the tokens requested, whether the transfer specifies
 a bundle size or literal token IDs. When a transfer specifies a bundle size, the fulfill request may 
 instead specify literal token IDs with a message body like this:
```
{ tokens: [ token_id, token_id, token_id ] }
```
#### Response, a transfer object:
```
200: OK
{
  id: transfer_id
  type: send, deduct, or managed
  parameters: {
    tokens: [token_id,token_id,token_id]
    |or|
    bundle: { bundle_size: integer }
  }
  state: completed
  created_at: date
  closed_at: date
  active:true
  claim:false
  originating_wallet: walletNameOrID
  source_wallet: walletNameOrID
  destination_wallet: walletNameOrID
}
```
#### Errors:
```
404: Not Found
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">Error ... Cannot POST /transfers/<transfer_id>/fullfill
```
> *fix:* In the path, spell *fulfill* with 3 ells, not 4.
```
403: Forbidden
403: Current account has no permission to fulfill this transfer
```
> *cause:* The target destination can either accept or decline. It cannot fulfill.
The transfer asks the target wallet to *receive* tokens, not send them.
The transfer state is `pending`, not `requested`. 
```
403: Forbidden
403: Operation forbidden, the transfer state is wrong
```
> *cause:* The transfer has already been completed, declined, or cancelled
```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422: "implicit" is required
```
> *fix:* Add the missing message body, probably: `{"implicit":"true"}`
```
422: Unprocessable Entity
422: "implicit" is not allowed
```
> *fix:* In the message body, do not write *both* literal token IDs 
and the implicit property. Use one or the other, most likely `implicit:true`
```
403: Forbidden
403: No need to specify tokens
```
> *fix:* In the message body, write `implicit:true`, not a list of token IDs. The transfer request already specifies token IDs. The API does not allow them to be specified again.

403: Too many tokens to transfer, please provide n tokens for this transfer
```
> *fix:* You provided fewer or more token IDs than the transfer requested in the `bundle_size` property. In the message body, write `implicit:true`. Or provide an array with the correct number of valid token IDs.
```
500 Internal Server Error
500: Unknown error (... invalid input syntax for type uuid: "$tokenid")
```
> *fix:* You probably wrote a bad token ID. In the message body, write `implicit:true`. 
Or provide an array of valid token IDs.

## Decline Transfer

The target wallet of a transfer--whether its the source or destination--refuses to complete the transfer.
```
POST /wallet/transfers/<transfer_id>/decline
```
> <transfer_id>: Replace with a transfer ID.

#### Response, a transfer object:
```
200: OK
{
  id: transfer_id
  type: send, deduct, or managed
  parameters: {
    tokens: [token_id,token_id,token_id]
    |or|

403: The transfer state is not pending and requested
```
> *cause:* The transfer has already been either completed, deleted, or declined.
```
403: Forbidden
403: Current account has no permission to decline this transfer
```
> *cause:* Only the target wallet can decline a transfer. 
The originating wallet can only `DELETE`.
```
404: Not Found
404: Can not found transfer by id:<transfer_id>
```
> *fix:* Fix the transfer ID in the path.

[^ back to top ^](#treetracker-wallet-api-reference)

## Delete Transfer

The originator cancels a transfer before target accepts or fulfills it.
```
DELETE /wallet/transfers/<transfer_id>
```
> <transfer_id>: Replace with a transfer ID.

#### Response, a transfer object:
```
200: OK

## Trust Relationships Explained

A *trust relationship* allows one wallet to move tokens
to or from another without getting permission for each individual transfer.
It can let Alice transfer tokens to Bob, for example, without Bob posting his acceptance.

#### Who Trusts Who?

GET [`/wallet/trust_relationships`](#get-trusts) lists the trust 
relationships that your wallets are party to.

#### Request and Accept Trust

To create a trust relationship, the `originating` wallet posts a message 
that specifies the other party to the relationship, called the `requestee`. Then the
requestee either accepts or declines the arrangement.

Once accepted, a trust remains in effect indefinitely, until either party cancels it.

#### Trust Relationship Roles

`Originator, requester, actor`: These three terms mean the same 
thing and have the same value. A trust relaionship begins with the origin's
request to create it.

`Requestee, target`: These two terms mean the same thing and
have the same value. A trust takes effect when the requestee accepts it.

#### Decline or Delete a Trust

The originator can cancel a trust at any time--before or after acceptance--with a `DELETE` request.

The requestee can refuse at any time--before or after acceptance--with a `decline` request.

#### Trust Request Types

Four kinds of trust request allow tokens to move to or from either party, under the control of either party, as follows:

`send`: The originating wallet can transfer its tokens to the requestee's wallet.

`manage`: The originating wallet can transfer its tokens to the requestee's wallet.
The originating wallet can also transfer the requestee's tokens to itself.

`receive`: The requestee's wallet can transfer its tokens to the originating wallet.

`yield`: The requestee wallet can transfer its tokens to the originating wallet.
The requestee wallet can also transfer the originator's tokens to itself.
```
Origin gets to transfer this way:
send:         origin's token ---> requestee's wallet
deduct:      origin's wallet <--- requestee's token
manage:      both send and deduct
         Requestee gets to transfer this way:
receive:    origin's wallet <--- requestee's token
release:     origin's token ---> requestee's wallet
yield:      both receive and release
```

## Get Trusts

Get a list of requested, established, and/or cancelled trust relationships related to the currently authorized wallet and any wallets it manages.
```
GET /wallet/trust_relationships?limit=n&start=n&state=string&request_type=string&type=string
```
> limit: Required integer. The maximum number of trust objects to return.

> start: Optional integer, defaults to 1, the beginning. Of the trust objects on the server, the one to start the list. But the precise order of trust records is unpredictable.

> state: Optional string:

- `trusted`: Active trust relationship

- `requested`: Trust relationship awaiting acceptance by the requestee.

- `cancelled_by_originator`: Trust relationship cancelled by the wallet that posted the initial request to create the trust.

- `cancelled_by_target`: Trust relationship was cancelled by the requestee.

> request_type: Optional string

- `send`: The originating wallet can transfer its tokens to the requestee's wallet.

- `manage`: The originating wallet can transfer its tokens to the requestee's wallet.
The originating wallet can also transfer the requestee's tokens to itself.

- `receive`: The requestee's wallet can transfer its tokens to the originating wallet.

- `yield`: The requestee wallet can transfer its tokens to the originating wallet.
The requestee wallet can also transfer the originator's tokens to itself.

> type: Optional string

- `send`: One wallet can give tokens to the other.

- `manage`: One wallet can both give and take tokens to and from the other.

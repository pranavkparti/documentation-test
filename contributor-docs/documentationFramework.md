## Indexing existing documentation
- See [Documentation Inventory](documentationInventory.md)


## Auditing existing information
The documentation is outdated, ambiguous, partial, and scattered. It exists in sources such as:
- In various Gitbook spaces, many of which are inaccesible as:
  - their published spaces are not linked anywhere
  - their published spaces are not indexed by google
  - the Greenstand Gitbook is locked behind authorization
- In repos and wikis as given in the [Documentation Inventory](documentationInventory.md)


## Standardizing the documentation

![img.png](../assets/img.png)

Using the above image as a guideline, we can divide the documentation into 2 types (for now):
1. User Documentation (End users)
2. Technical/System Documentation (Contributors)
   - We ignore the third party integrations for later

  
- **User documentation**
  - Support Portals
  - FAQs
  - Video tutorials
  - Step-by-step guides
  - Embedded assistance
  - Software requirements.
  - Installation guide.
  - How to start the system.
  - How to use features of a product.
  - Screenshots explaining those features.
  - Contacts of the developer if an undocumented question arises and more.

### New framework
- Single Documentation Portal
  - All the documentation is consolidated under `docs.greenstand.org`, via Gitbook
  - All documentation is up to date
- Keeping a changelog
- All relevant project repos have a `docs/` directory corresponding to a Gitbook space.
- Sustainable processes for maintaining documentation.

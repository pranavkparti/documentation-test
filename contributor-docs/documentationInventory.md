Documentation Inventory
======================================
The grant-application/documentation plan calls for
"indexing and auditing the status of all existing documentation."
To that end, here is a list of directories, repos, websites, etc.
that contain documention, as of July 12, 2023.

This list includes all the documents listed in issue 18 of the
greenstand-documentation repo
(<https://github.com/Greenstand/greenstand-documentation/issues/18>)

Let's expand, amend, and annotate this list to keep track of
document status: Is a file up-to-date? Rewritten as an *.md file
in this repo? Deleted?

### Status
- **Up to date** - nothing needs to be done
- **To be reviewed** - quality of information needs to be determined
- **To be updated** - information may be outdated, ambiguous, or missing
- **To be deleted** - irrelevant, unnecessary or redundant
- **Unknown**
